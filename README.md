## Midland's EAST Projects:


### - *Hometown Heroes*: Project member(s)- Katelyn Bonee and Brittany Smith.
Description: Midland EAST was contacted by the Old Independence Regional Museum along with Batesville High School, Southside High School, Southside Junior High, and Cedar Ridge High EAST Programs to help create a documentary. Students Brittany Smith and Katelyn Bonee jumped on board. The museum wanted a documentary about how sports have impacted communities, and these two students couldnâ€™t wait to help. This was sponsored through the Smithsonian Museum and even has its own display at the Old Independence Regional Museum currently. Students did a lot of research to gather all of the information, pictures, and schedule the interviews. They also used Final Cut Pro to edit the video. After the documentary was completed it was shown at the Melba in Batesville, and then put on display for the public at the local museum. This was an ongoing project which took about a year and a half to complete.

### - *City Storm Shelter*: Project member(s)- Bailey Piety and Erica Janson.
Description: We are working on putting a local tornado shelter to help make our community feel safer. We would like to put the storm shelter somewhere in pleasant plains so that everyone will be able to find it and access it quickly during a storm. We decided to do this project because we noticed that people would feel more safe knowing that when a nasty storm or tornado comes, they can go to a safe place to wait it out and make sure everything is okay. We have been working on a model for the storm shelter using SketchUp. Once we make sure that it meets all the state standards we can start looking for grants and a exact location for the shelter, with pre-approval from the mayor and city council. Along with the storm shelter, we have also looked at several tornado sirens for the local area to keep people alert in case of an emergency.
