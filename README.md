### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MHSEAST/mhseast.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.


Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.
