## Midland's EAST Projects:


### - *Hometown Heroes*: Project member(s)- Katelyn Bonee and Brittany Smith.
Description: Midland EAST was contacted by the Old Independence Regional Museum along with Batesville High School, Southwest High School, Southside Junior High, and Cedar Ridge High EAST Programs to assist in creating a documentary. Students Brittney Smith and Katelyn Bonee quickly collaborated. The museum wanted a documentary describing the impact sports had on communities, and these two students couldn’t wait to assist. The documentary was sponsored through the Smithsonian Museum. It currently has its own display at the Old Independence Regional Museum. Students conducted quite a bit of research to gather the information, pictures, and interviews. Final Cut Pro was used to edit the video. After the documentary was completed, it was presented at the Melba in Batesville. It was then put on display for the public at the local museum. This was an ongoing project that took about a year and a half to complete.

### - *City Storm Shelter*: Project member(s)- Bailey Piety and Erica Janson.
Description: Bailey Piety and Erica Janson are students that attend Midland East. They are working on building a local tornado shelter to help make their community feel more secure during inclement weather. They would like to put the storm shelter in Pleasant Plains (AR) area. They wish to ensure that everyone will have quick and easy access -to the shelter- during storms. They came to the decision to build a shelter to put the citizens at ease. The students have been creating a model for the storm shelter using SketchUp. Once they confirm that it meets all the state standards, they can begin looking for grants and a precise location for the shelter. Pre-approval from the mayor and city council is required. Along with the storm shelter, they have looked at several tornado sirens for the local area. The sirens will keep people alert in case of an emergency.

### - *City Park*: Project member(s)- Payton Kirk, Christian Throckmorton, Brianna Reed, and Christopher Bonee.
Description: Brianna Reed, Christopher Bonee, Christian Throckmorton, and Payton Kirk finished their first project (getting new bleachers for the gym). Therefore, they moved on to find another project. They decided to ask the Mayor of Pleasant Plains, Mr. Burns, for a project. He told us one that he needed help on updating the old park. The problem was that he needed help with designing a playground and needed the material for it too. He told us that we needed measurements, gravel, and a model for a slide to finish it. Thus, they went to the old park and measured part of the volleyball court. After that the students went back to the classroom to start with the real work. Christopher and Brianna went to call the gravel company while Christian and Payton went to work a model for the playground. It took at least a week to finish the model and the gravel to come in. We showed the mayor on what they  accomplished;  he was amazed at the amount of work that the group of students have done in that time. He told us to go to the town meetings to present the project. The students went to the city council meeting and was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation, because of all their hard-work.

### - *360 Map*: Project member(s)- Belinda Jaco.
Description: This project is for upcoming 7th graders and new students coming to Midland. In this project Belinda has been using a 360 camera to take pictures and basically use them like Google “Street View”. The program she’s been using is HoloBuilder. Holobuilder is a program that you can insert 360 pictures and have “action arrows” that let you walk around, input information, or even insert a link by using these action arrows. In previous years new students coming to the high school campus have been getting lost trying to find their classes and being late because of this. She used G.A.I.D.E. to help me on this project. She gathered information on previous 7th graders and asked them what classes were the hardest to find, why was it hard to find, if this map was available for you at the time, would you have used it. Surveying the students helped me understand more about what the problem was while doing her project. After she got this information she started assessing their needs. Some of the students said they were confused which teacher taught what and where they were located. Inside the classrooms there are bubbles saying what the teacher teaches and a look around of their classroom. At the moment she’s still developing the map for the new students coming to our campus.

### - *Public Library*: Project member(s)- Bobby Montgomery and Eli Milam.
Description: The closest library to Pleasant Plains is in Pangburn, which is twenty miles away. Students Bobby Montgomery and Eli Milam decided that they wanted to come up with a way to make library resources more accessible to their community. The students started designing a layout for this idea, using Google Sketchup, and are presenting it to the Mayor, Kenneth Burns. They’re currently waiting to figure out the ideal location for the Community Library. Students are also looking to provide funding for this project through grant funding and other funding options. This project will also provide more jobs for the community as well.

### - *Public Greenhouse*: Project member(s)- William Kelly and Mason Grammer.
Description: The Greenhouse Project was originally thought of by Mason and William. They were inspired by North Little Rock school districts; they have placed greenhouse’s in their community’s. These greenhouses have grown to 20 greenhouses over the course of five years. Mason and William saw how far they had come with their projects and they decided that they should have a greenhouse garden. They started brainstorming over the design of what they thought it should look like. After trial and error with their designs, they just researched the type of shape that it should be to maximize on efficiency. Mason was actually given a greenhouse frame by a family member, so we then just added the greenhouse to our project. They now have the location planned for the greenhouse, which is located on the High-school premises. Right now they am waiting on the board to confirm the project with the setting of the greenhouse on the school property.

### - *Midland Schools EAST Website*: Project member(s)- Rachel Puentez and Carlos Huesca.
Description: My partner and I are currently working on an EAST website for our school. We really need an EAST website for our school because not many people know much about EAST or what takes place in EAST. We are not as updated with technology as other people are, but we are still working on the website daily with the help of our technology coordinator, Mr. Pruitt. As of now we are unable to edit the original site so we actually had to make our own website. At first, we started using Wordpress and tried to use it, but we were at a loss so we started using a site called Weebly. After we came back from break everything was working smooth until I logged into Weebly and the website homepage was messed up. Currently, I am trying to resolve the issue and I'm thinking about switching back to Wordpress since Mrs. Motes husband knows more about the program and could help me better understand where to place the HTML codes.

### - *Map of School Bus Routes*: Project member(s)- Payton Kirk, Christian Throckmorton, Brianna Reed, and Christopher Bonee.
Description: Rachel and Carlos are currently working on an EAST website for our school. Our program really need an EAST website for our school because not many people know much about EAST or what takes place in EAST. So the students want to have our schools EAST program more well known. Our technology aren’t as updated as other programs are, but they’re still working on the website daily with the help of our technology coordinator, Mr Pruitt. As of now they’re unable to edit the original site so the students actually had to make own website. At first, they started using Wordpress and tried to use it, but we were at a loss so they started using a site called Weebly. After the students came back from Christmas break everything was working smooth until one of the students logged into Weebly and the website homepage was messed up. Currently, they’re trying to resolve the issue and they’re thinking about switching back to Wordpress since Mrs. Motes husband knows more about the program and could help them better understand where to place the HTML codes.
