## Welcome to Midland High School's EAST Conference Presentation.

### During this presentation you will learn about Critical thinking skills, Teamwork, and Determination. This presentation will show you that improving your community is a lot more than just thinking about ways to improve it. It takes the self-motivation of yourself to make an impact that changes your community's outward and inward apperance.
### Your presenters for this week are Rachel Puentez, Arthur Boswell, Carlos Huesca, Hayden Wood, Alexis Summers, and Christian Throckmorton.



## Midland's EAST Projects:


### - *Hometown Heroes*: Project member(s)- Katelyn Bonee and Brittany Smith.
Description: Midland EAST was contacted by the Old Independence Regional Museum along with Batesville High School, Southside High School, Southside Junior High, and Cedar Ridge High EAST Programs to help create a documentary. Students Brittany Smith and Katelyn Bonee jumped on board. The museum wanted a documentary about how sports have impacted communities, and these two students couldn’t wait to help. This was sponsored through the Smithsonian Museum and even has its own display at the Old Independence Regional Museum currently. Students did a lot of research to gather all of the information, pictures, and schedule the interviews. They also used Final Cut Pro to edit the video. After the documentary was completed it was shown at the Melba in Batesville, and then put on display for the public at the local museum. This was an ongoing project which took about a year and a half to complete.

### - *City Storm Shelter*: Project member(s)- Bailey Piety and Erica Janson.
Description: We are working on putting a local tornado shelter to help make our community feel safer. We would like to put the storm shelter somewhere in pleasant plains so that everyone will be able to find it and access it quickly during a storm. We decided to do this project because we noticed that people would feel more safe knowing that when a nasty storm or tornado comes, they can go to a safe place to wait it out and make sure everything is okay. We have been working on a model for the storm shelter using SketchUp. Once we make sure that it meets all the state standards we can start looking for grants and a exact location for the shelter, with pre-approval from the mayor and city council. Along with the storm shelter, we have also looked at several tornado sirens for the local area to keep people alert in case of an emergency.

### - *City Park*: Project member(s)- Payton Kirk, Christian Throckmorton, Brianna Reed, and Christopher Bonee.

### - *360 Map*: Project member(s)- Belinda Jaco.

### - *Public Library*: Project member(s)- Bobby Montgomery and Eli Milam.
Description: The closest library to Pleasant Plains is in Pangburn, which is twenty miles away. Students Bobby Montgomery and Eli Milam decided they wanted to come up with a way to make library resources more accessible to their community. The students started designing a layout for this idea, using Google Sketchup, and are presenting it to the Mayor, Kenneth Burns. They are currently waiting to figure out the ideal location for the Community Library. Students are also looking to provide funding for this project through grant funding and other funding options. This will also provide more jobs for the community as well.

### - *Public Greenhouse*: Project member(s)- William Kelly and Mason Grammer.
Description: The Greenhouse Project was originally though of because Mason and I were inspired by North Little Rock school districts that have placed greenhouse’s in their community’s, which over the course of 5 years have grown to 20 greenhouse gardens. Mason and I seen how far they had come with their projects and we decided that we too should have a greenhouse garden. We started Brainstorming over the design of what we think it should look like. After seeing how terrible our designs were, we just looked up the type of shape that it should be to maximize on efficiency.  Mason was actually given a greenhouse frame by a family member, so we then just added the greenhouse to our project. I now have the location planned for the greehouse, which is located on the High-school premises. Right now I am waiting on the board to confirm the project with the setting of the greenhouse on the school property.
