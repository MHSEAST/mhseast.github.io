## Midland's EAST Projects:


### - *Hometown Heroes*: Project member(s)- Kateelyn Bonee and Brittany Smith.
Description: Midland EAST was contacted by the Old Independence Regional Museum along with Batesville High School, Southwest High School, Southside Junior High, and Cedar Ridge High EAST Programs to help create a documentary. Students Brittany Smith and Kateelyn Bonee jumped on board. The museum wanted a documentary about how sports have impacted communities, and these two students couldn't wait to help. This was sponsored through the Smithsonian Museum and even has its own display at the Old Independence Regional Museum currently. Students did a lot of research to gather all of the information, pictures, and interviews. They also used Final Cut Pro to edit the video. After the documentary was completed it was shown at the Melba in Batesville, and then put on display for the public at the local museum. This was an ongoing project which took about a year and a half to complete.

### - *City Storm Shelter*: Project member(s)- Bailey Piety and Erica Janson.
Description: We are working on putting a local tornado shelter to help make our community feel safer. We would like to put the storm shelter somewhere in pleasant plains so that everyone will be able to find it and access it quickly during a storm. We decided to do this project because we noticed that people would feel more safe knowing that when a nasty storm or tornado comes, they can go to a safe place to wait it out and make sure everything is okay. We have been working on a model for the storm shelter using SketchUp. Once we make sure that it meets all the state standards we can start looking for grants and a exact location for the shelter, with pre-approval from the mayor and city council. Along with the storm shelter, we have also looked at several tornado sirens for the local area to keep people alert in case of an emergency.

### - *City Park*: Project member(s)- Payton Kirk, Christian Throckmorton, Brianna Reed, and Christopher Bonee.
Description: Brianna, Christopher, Mason, Christian, and I were done with our first project which was getting new bleachers for the gym. Therefore, we moved on to find another project. We decided to ask the Mayor of Pleasant Plains, Mr. Burns, for a project. He told us one that he needed help on updating the old park. The problem was that he needed help with designing a playground and needed the material for it too. He told us that we needed measurements, gravel, and a model for a slide to finish it. Thus, we went to the old park and measured part of the volleyball court. After that we went back to the classroom to start with the real work. Mason, Christopher, and Brianna went to call the gravel company while Christian and I went to work a model for the playground. It took at least a week to finish the model and the gravel to come in. We showed the mayor what we accomplished and he was amazed at the amount of work we done in that time. He told us to go to the town meetings to present the project. We went to the city council meeting and was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation because of all our hard-work.

### - *360 Map*: Project member(s)- Belinda Jaco.
Description: This project is for 7th graders and new students coming to Midland. In previous years new students coming to the high school campus have been getting lost trying to find their classes and being late because of this. This project will help them learn were each classroom is, who the teachers are, and what subjects they teach. In this project I've used a 360 camera to take pictures and basically use them like Google Street View. The program I am using is HoloBuilder, which I can easily access through our technology. Once the map is complete, incoming students will request a temporary link for the map. After receiving the map, the student will use it just like you use Google Earth "Street View". Using the map, they will find "Bubbles" on the screen containing information about the teacher, their subject, and their room number.

### - *Public Library*: Project member(s)- Bobby Montgomery and Eli Milam.
Description: The closest library to Pleasant Plains is in Pangburn, which is twenty miles away. Students Bobby Montgomery and Eli Milam decided they wanted to come up with a way to make library resources more accessible to their community. The students started designing a layout for this idea, using Google Sketchup, and are presenting it to the Mayor, Kenneth Burns. They are currently waiting to figure out the ideal location for the Community Library. Students are also looking to provide funding for this project through grant funding and other funding options. This will also provide more jobs for the community as well.

### - *Public Greenhouse*: Project member(s)- William Kelly and Mason Grammer.
Description: The Greenhouse Project was originally though of because Mason and I were inspired by North Little Rock school districts that have placed greenhouse’s in their community’s, which over the course of 5 years have grown to 20 greenhouse gardens. Mason and I seen how far they had come with their projects and we decided that we too should have a greenhouse garden. We started Brainstorming over the design of what we think it should look like. After seeing how terrible our designs were, we just looked up the type of shape that it should be to maximize on efficiency.  Mason was actually given a greenhouse frame by a family member, so we then just added the greenhouse to our project. I now have the location planned for the greenhouse, which is located on the High-school premises. Right now I am waiting on the board to confirm the project with the setting of the greenhouse on the school property.

### - *Midland Schools EAST Website*: Project member(s)- Rachel Puentez and Carlos Huesca.
Description: My partner and I are currently working on an EAST website for our school. We really need an EAST website for our school because not many people know much about EAST or what takes place in EAST. We are not as updated with technology as other people are, but we are still working on the website daily with the help of our technology coordinator, Mr. Pruitt. As of now we are unable to edit the original site so we actually had to make our own website. At first, we started using Wordpress and tried to use it, but we were at a loss so we started using a site called Weebly. After we came back from break everything was working smooth until I logged into Weebly and the website homepage was messed up. Currently, I am trying to resolve the issue and I'm thinking about switching back to Wordpress since Mrs. Motes husband knows more about the program and could help me better understand where to place the HTML codes.

### - *Map of School Bus Routes*: Project member(s)- Payton Kirk, Christian Throckmorton, Brianna Reed, and Christopher Bonee.
Description: When we were done with our part on our last project, we were going to ask the school for a new project but the superintendent had already told us about a project we can do when we were done. Therefore, we went to ask him about this project. He said it was bus routing project. This is so we can identify other roads for usage of our school buses. We started with the GPS equipment the school provided us with, however, the devices were out of date. Thus, we started the search for a new GPS coordinating 
systems and we got a email from the same company who own the previous GPS's, now we can use this email to get more and improved GPS's.
