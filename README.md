## Welcome to Midland High School's EAST Conference Presentation.

Here we will guide you through a journey of our school's EAST projects.


## A few of Midland's EAST Projects


### - *Hometown Heroes*
Description: Midland EAST was contacted by the Old Independence Regional Museum along with Batesville High School, Southside High School, Southside Junior High, and Cedar Ridge High EAST Programs to help create a documentary. Students Brittany Smith and Katelyn Bonee jumped on board. The museum wanted a documentary about how sports have impacted communities, and these two students couldnâ€™t wait to help. This was sponsored through the Smithsonian Museum and even has its own display at the Old Independence Regional Museum currently. Students did a lot of research to gather all of the information, pictures, and schedule the interviews. They also used Final Cut Pro to edit the video. After the documentary was completed it was shown at the Melba in Batesville, and then put on display for the public at the local museum. This was an ongoing project which took about a year and a half to complete.
